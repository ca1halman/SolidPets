# SolidPets - 0.2.1
**Note that this plugin is still in an alpha state and bugs are to be expected**

### What is SolidPets?
SolidPets is a spigot plugin with an interesting take on Pets. I don't believe there are any
other plugins with this type of implementation.

### How do pets work?
Pets are, rather than extensions of their parent entities, completely new entities (according to the server at least).
That means that they have 100% custom attributes, behaviors, AI, etc.

### Using SolidPets
*I will update this section when the plugin is more usable and not filled with crappy
test commands*
